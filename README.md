# Exact Multi-Polygon Overlap API

A pure backend service that computes the **overlap area of two groups of
multi-polygons** using **exact integer / rational arithmetic only**. There is
no database, no asynchronous worker, no frontend, no call to external online
services, and **no third-party geometry library** is used for intersection or
area — every geometric operation is implemented in this repository on top of
Python's `fractions.Fraction`.

* Python 3.13 target (also runs on 3.11+)
* FastAPI + Pydantic v2 + Uvicorn
* Coordinates are integer millimetres in `[-1_000_000, 1_000_000]`
* Result: reduced fraction `p/q` in mm² plus a half-up, three-decimal string

## Why exact arithmetic

Clipping with floating point makes the same parcel produce different areas
when vertices are listed in a different order, especially around concave
corners and holes where boundaries cross many times. Here every intersection
parameter `t`, every split vertex and every shoelace term is a `Fraction`, so:

* fractional intersections are represented exactly;
* edge/point contacts contribute exactly zero;
* concave edges that cross another boundary arbitrarily many times, hole
  cut-outs and coincident collinear edges are all handled;
* the result is provably independent of polygon, ring and vertex order
  (covered by permutation, reversal and symmetry tests).

## Algorithm

`app/geometry/arrangement.py` builds one planar arrangement:

1. Every ring edge is tagged with a signed **winding contribution**
   (exterior ring `+1`, hole ring `-1`, with the stored orientation).
2. Every pair of edges is intersected exactly (proper crossings, endpoint /
   T-junction contacts, and collinear overlaps). All common points are
   registered as rational cut parameters.
3. Cut edges become atomic segments; coincident pieces (including identical
   edges running in opposite directions) merge and their tags are summed.
4. A half-edge structure is formed and its face permutation recovers all
   boundary cycles (bounded CCW outer cycles and CW hole cycles, including the
   cycle of the unbounded face).
5. CW cycles are attached to the face of the innermost CCW cycle containing
   them, which realises hole nesting and set-difference semantics.
6. Crossing a segment from its right face to its left face changes each
   group's winding number by the aggregated tag; winding numbers are then
   propagated exactly from the unbounded face (winding `0/0`).
7. The overlap area is the signed shoelace-area sum over all boundary cycles
   of faces whose winding is positive for **both** groups.

Validation (`app/geometry/validation.py`) rejects malformed input with 422:

* fewer than three vertices, a repeated/closing vertex, a non-simple ring
  (non-adjacent edges crossing or touching, including collinear overlap);
* a hole not strictly inside its exterior or touching it;
* holes touching each other;
* polygons of the same group whose interiors intersect or whose boundaries
  touch (a polygon strictly inside another polygon's *hole* is allowed).

Ring orientation (CW/CCW) carries no semantic meaning; it is normalised by the
signed area. A hole nested strictly inside another hole contributes nothing
(set difference: `exterior − ⋃ holes`).

## API

### `GET /health`

```json
{"status": "ok"}
```

### `POST /api/v1/overlap`

```json
{
  "a": [
    {
      "exterior": [[0, 0], [6, 0], [6, 6], [0, 6]],
      "holes": [[[2, 2], [4, 2], [4, 4], [2, 4]]]
    }
  ],
  "b": [
    {
      "exterior": [[1, 1], [5, 1], [5, 5], [1, 5]],
      "holes": []
    }
  ]
}
```

Response `200`:

```json
{
  "area_sq_mm": [12, 1],
  "numerator": 12,
  "denominator": 1,
  "decimal": "12.000",
  "rounding": "half-up",
  "units": "mm^2"
}
```

Fractional example (two triangles overlapping in a triangle of ½ mm²):

```json
{
  "area_sq_mm": [1, 2],
  "numerator": 1,
  "denominator": 2,
  "decimal": "0.500",
  "rounding": "half-up",
  "units": "mm^2"
}
```

`decimal` rounds the exact fraction **half-up** to exactly three digits
(`0.0005 → 0.001`), implemented with integer arithmetic rather than `round()`.

### Errors (all 422 use one structured envelope)

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "invalid_request",
    "message": "request payload does not satisfy the schema",
    "details": [
      {"loc": ["a", 0, "exterior", 2], "type": "value_error", "message": "..."}
    ]
  }
}
```

* `invalid_request` — schema/type/range problems (non-integers, out of range
  coordinates, wrong shape, malformed JSON).
* `invalid_geometry` — well-formed coordinates that violate a geometric rule
  (non-simple ring, hole not strictly inside, touching polygons, …).

## Running with Docker Compose

```bash
docker compose up --build
# API on http://localhost:${API_PORT:-8000}
```

Override the **host** port with `API_PORT`:

```bash
API_PORT=9090 docker compose up --build
```

### One-shot acceptance service

```bash
docker compose run --rm verify
```

`verify` waits until the API container is healthy, then runs the whole pytest
suite inside the image, including live HTTP acceptance tests
(`tests/test_http_acceptance.py`) against the running API, and exits non-zero
on the first failure.

## Local development

```bash
python3.13 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

uvicorn app.main:app --reload
pytest -q                                   # 80 pass, 6 skipped offline

EXACT_AREA_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000 pytest -q   # with a server running:
                                                      # all 86 tests execute
```

## Test suite

* `tests/test_api.py` — endpoint behaviour, fraction reduction, half-up
  rounding, contacts = 0, and order/rotation/orientation independence.
* `tests/test_validation.py` — every 422 rule and the structured error body.
* `tests/test_geometry_units.py` — primitives: orientation, point-on-segment,
  fractional intersection, simplicity detection, rounding table.
* `tests/test_differential.py` — an independent exact reference (vertical-slab
  integration with mid-sample containment, a different algorithm) plus
  randomized differential testing and self-overlap identities.
* `tests/test_engine_heavy.py` — hundreds of random intersecting
  triangles/rectangles, multi-polygon grids, coincident/partial edges,
  T-junctions and multi-hole strips.
* `tests/test_http_acceptance.py` — live black-box checks used by `verify`.
